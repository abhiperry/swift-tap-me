# Tap Me!
Tap Me! is a game that is coded with **Swift 3.0**

##### You can develop yourself in these topics:
1. Creating timer like encounter and downcounter with Swift 3.0 // ` NSTimer(); `
2. Creating temporary database with Swift 3.0 // ` NSUserDefaults(); `
3. Working with functions. // ` func gameSetup(){ .. } `
4. Xcode constraints (this is so annoying, everybody knows :joy: )


##### Notes for potential users:
- It can help you to learn and develop applications or games for iOS platform.
- It was coded one year ago in my free times.
- 2 player mode is not developed.
- There may be some errors about Swift new versions, if you write me, then, I can fix it.
- I am not going to develop Tap Me, this is first and last version of the game.
